## Overview
This dashboard provides a comprehensive view of sales performance across different dimensions, including product, segment, month, and discount band. It also includes key metrics such as total profit, total sale price, and total units sold.

### Key Components
#### 1. Sum of Sale Price by Product

+ The product Paseo leads in sales with 21.9K, followed by VTT (15.1K) and Velo (12.6K).
+ The lowest-performing product is Carretera (10.4K).
  
#### 2. Sum of Sale Price by Segment

+ Small Business accounts for the highest percentage (45.48%), followed by Midmarket (36.19%).
+ Government sales are minimal (1.81%), indicating a potential area for growth or low market penetration.
  
#### 3. Sum of Sale Price by Month

+ Sales were relatively stable at around 4K per month, with peaks in July (8K), October (17K), and December (12K).
+ The significant increase in October could indicate a seasonal sales trend, while December could be attributed to holiday sales.
  
#### 4. Sum of Sale Price by Discount Band

+ The majority of sales come from the "None" (34.09%) and "Medium" (34.16%) discount bands, indicating that discounts are not the primary driver of sales.
+ The "Low" (25.85%) and "High" (5.91%) discount bands contribute less, suggesting that extreme discounts are not a significant factor in revenue generation.
  
### Conclusions and Insights
+ Top-performing products: Paseo and VTT drive the most revenue. Efforts should be made to maintain their momentum while boosting lower-performing products.
+ Segment focus: Small businesses and midmarket segments generate most of the sales, while government sales are minimal. Consider strategies to penetrate the government sector further.
+ Seasonal trends: October and December saw the highest sales, which could indicate a seasonal effect. Marketing strategies should align with these peak periods.
+ Discount strategy: Since most sales occur without heavy discounting, it is advisable to maintain the pricing structure while experimenting with strategic discounts in underperforming segments or months.

### Recommendations
+ Strengthen marketing efforts for lower-performing products like Carretera and Montana.
+ Explore growth opportunities in the Government sector, potentially by adjusting pricing or sales strategies.
+ Prepare for peak sales periods (October and December) by ensuring adequate inventory and targeted promotions.
+ Maintain a balanced discounting approach, focusing on medium-tier discounts to maximize profitability.
